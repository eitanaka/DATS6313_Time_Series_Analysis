# Question 1
# Write a python function called ‚Äúcorrelation_coefficent_cal(x,y)‚Äù that implements the correlation
# coefficient between random variable x and y. The formula for correlation coefficient is given
# below. The function should be written in a general form that can work for any dataset x and
# dataset y. The return value for this function is r. Test the developed code with the following makeup dataset for x, y, z, h & g.
# a. The correlation coefficient between x and y. Display the answer on the console.
# b. The correlation coefficient between x and z. Display the answer on the console.
# c. The correlation coefficient between g and h. Display the answer on the console.
# Verify a, b and c using a python program.
